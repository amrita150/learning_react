## React Challenge - 5  
### "Pet Mood Tracker"

**Challenge Description:** Create a React app that features a digital pet with different moods. The pet's appearance should change based on its mood. This pet needs to eat, sleep, and play. But you also want it to change its appearance based on its mood, and you need to do other things when it gets hungry or sleepy.This challenge will help you practice using the useEffect hook to manage timing and state changes in React.


**Challenge Tasks:**

1. Set up a new React app.

2. Create a Pet component that displays an image of a pet with an initial happy mood.

3. Implement state variables for `mood` and `image` within the Pet component.

4. Use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `mood` state variable.

5. Create buttons (e.g., "Feed," "Play," "Sleep") to change the pet's mood when clicked.

6. Inside the `useEffect`, update the `image` state based on the pet's mood. For example, if the mood is "hungry," update the image to a hungry pet image.

7. Display the current mood above or below the pet image.
