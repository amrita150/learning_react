## Basic React useState and useEffect Example

This code is a basic React application that manages two state variables, count and multiple, using the useState hook. It provides buttons to increment count and double multiple. Additionally, it uses useEffect to display alerts when these state variables change. The user interface displays the current values of count and multiple.

This code demonstrates how to manage state changes and trigger side effects using useState and useEffect in a React application.
