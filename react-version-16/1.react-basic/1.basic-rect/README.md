# rules for jsx
## we use className in jsx instead of class

## use {} to write js expression



# what we do 
## Make a file called Welcome.jsx and write a JSX component that:

Shows a heading “Welcome to StudySync”

Shows a subtext “Your verified college study space”

Wraps both in a div

Uses a variable appName and inserts it inside JSX using {}
